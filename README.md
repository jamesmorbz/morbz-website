# Brainstorming

- Smaller Chessboards that focus on certain patterns (3x3, 4x4) - Similar to Pocket Chess

- Generic "How the Pieces Move"

- Automatic Generation of User Specific Improvement Plan (Based on an recommended calibration?!)

- Capture User Preferences and Give Recommendations based on their preferences (Their Favourite Openings)

- Chess Preperation Against User Specific

- "Game Of The Day" Could be generic or Specific to user, Or Both!

- User Asks for a specific Number of Puzzles and general rating range

- Generate %Score of correct answers across the puzzles completed, give them rating performance as well. 

- Could even create an internal rating system and leaderboard

- Leaderboard could also extend to people who had done the "most learning"

- Have a "Guest User" Demo Version with preset routing as POC, then push user to signup and login

- Track Metrics and Most popular Areas of the Website

- Offer Chess.com / Lichess.org / Chess24.com Integration for the user so they can track their own metrics and improvements against their learning/training

- Create an area where users can arrange games against each other. Encourage people who want to learn and challenge themselves to play against each other.

- Leads to competitive and higher class games and hence stimulates improvement
